# Files-Dist: Webpack Configuration  

This project demonstrates how to use Webpack to bundle and optimize a simple web application.  

---

## üöÄ Features: What It Does  

- **JavaScript Bundling**:  
  Takes the main JavaScript file (`script.js`) specified in the `entry` property and combines it with any dependencies into a single, optimized `bundle.js` file. This reduces the number of requests made by the browser.  

- **CSS Processing and Injection**:  
  Processes all CSS files using `css-loader` (to interpret `@import` and `url()`) and `style-loader` (to inject the CSS into the DOM). This ensures your CSS is dynamically applied to the HTML at runtime without needing separate CSS files.  

- **HTML Optimization**:  
  The `HtmlWebpackPlugin` takes your `index.html` file as a template, injects references to the bundled JavaScript file (`bundle.js`), and minifies the HTML by:  
  - Removing comments.  
  - Collapsing unnecessary whitespace.  

- **Clean Output Directory**:  
  The `clean: true` option in the `output` configuration ensures that the `dist` folder is cleared before each build, removing old or unused files.  

- **Production-Ready Output**:  
  By setting `mode: 'production'`, Webpack automatically applies optimizations, including:  
  - Minification of JavaScript.  
  - Tree-shaking to remove unused code.  
  - Better performance and smaller bundle size.

            if (
                e.key === 'F12' ||
                (e.ctrlKey && e.shiftKey && e.key === 'I') ||
                (e.metaKey && e.altKey && e.key === 'I') ||
                (e.ctrlKey && e.shiftKey && e.key === 'J') ||
                (e.ctrlKey && e.key === 'U')
            ) {
                e.preventDefault();
